# Crypto Challenges!

A friend recommended that I look at the
[matasano crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) again.

I did some of these in python back when I was in school (and back when it was
email-only), but I figured it would be a fun way to try to learn more rust! So,
I fired up vim, and here we are.

I'm not entirely sure how far in I'll go â€“ I'll probably get sidetracked by life
and work and all that. But, who doesn't have 50billion dangling side projects?

Avast, ye landlubbers!
